    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for making Vietname pho. If you’re sitting there and wondering “what is pho,” it’s a delicate (and delicious) Vietnamese noodle soup made from beef bones, ginger, onions, and lots of aromatic spices. It’s nothing short of soup perfection. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h5>BROTH</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>5 to 6 pounds of beef knuckles or leg bones</li>
        <li>6 quarts cold water</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>6 star anise</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1-inch piece yellow rock suga</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>ASSEMBLY</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound small (1/8-inch wide) dried or fresh “banh pho” noodles</li>
        <li>1/2 pound raw eye of round, sirloin or tri-tip steak, thinly sliced across the grain</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts

        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Add beef bones to a large pot that will hold at least 10 quarts. Then, cover bones with cold water. Place pot onto high heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain bones, discarding the water. Then, rinse bones with warm water and scrub stockpot to remove any residue that has stuck to the sides. Add the bones back to the stockpot and cover with 6 quarts of cold water.</li>
        <li>Add cinnamon sticks, ginger, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves and the black cardamom pod to a dry frying pan. Place onto low heat and cook, stirring occasionally until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Bring stockpot with parboiled bones and water to a boil then lower to a gentle simmer. Add charred onion and ginger as well as the bag or sachet of toasted spices. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt, a 1/4 cup of fish sauce and the rock sugar. Continue to simmer broth, uncovered, for 3 hours. If at any time foam or scum rises to the surface, use a spoon to remove it.</li>
        <li>Use tongs or a wide mesh spoon to remove bones, onion and ginger from broth then strain broth through a fine mesh strainer. The broth will have a layer of fat at the the top. There are two ways to remove this. First, if you plan to enjoy the broth now, skim the fat from the top of the broth using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bring the broth to a gentle simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>If you are using dried noodles, add noodles to a bowl then cover with hot water and soak for 15 to 20 minutes until soft and opaque. If you are using fresh, add to a colander then rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>To cook the noodles, bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Place noodles into boiling water and cook for about 10 seconds or until they collapse. Drain noodles then divide between bowls. </li>
        <li>Arrange slices of raw meat into bowls, and then top with the hot broth. Finish broth with onion slices and cilantro. Serve bowls with a plate of optional garnishes listed above.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Add any condiments that you would love. Saracha, hoison sauce, limes and chilli oil are recommended for better taste. </p>
